			I hate my husband very much every day. I often say to him, "You'd better not go home for dinner. You'd better wait until my children and I are full after work. I don't want to cook for you...". He said helplessly, "If I don't go home to eat, where can I eat?". As a result, he really went home after eating outside for several days, and then he had to go to buy vegetables for me when he came back from eating, because he did not eat at home, but my children and I had to eat.
